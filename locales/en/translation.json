These projects were my first real experiments in game design, graphics programming, and performance optimization on mobile devices.\n\nThe first game, **Glypy**, is a classic platformer where the player progresses by overcoming obstacles, jumps, and enemies, keeping a simple but fun style. The second one, **Xalatax**, is an arcade-style shoot ’em up packed with fast action, continuous firing, and a strong retro inspiration. Both projects represent a very special stage of experimentation and learning that helped shape my path as a developer."
